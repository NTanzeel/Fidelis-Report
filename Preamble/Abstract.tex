Social media platforms have become the modern way to stay informed and up-to-date on global events, explore content and interact with family and friends. As the number of users with internet access grows, a phenomenon we are currently observing with the increased availability of smartphones, it is important to consider how current social media platforms can be enhanced to improve user confidence and trust on them. This paper explores how such enhancements can be provided by looking at the implementation of a trust-based social network for user engagement and protection. By combining abuse detection, reputation scoring, content filtering and content recommendations, the goal of the platform is to provide users with a safe environment in which they can discover curated and personalised content, tailored to the user's preferences. In this paper, we provide a detailed discussion of the design and implementation and evaluate the overall system performance.
