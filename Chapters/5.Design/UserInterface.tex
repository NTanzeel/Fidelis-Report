\section{User Interface}
The user interface (UI) is perhaps one of the most important aspects of Fidelis; the UI dictates how users interact with the system, and serves as the single point of entry for user data. Fidelis needs to be able to engage the audience from the moment they land on the homepage and encourage the users to explore further by providing an easy to use and intuitive UI. This can be achieved by following standards defined by several committees and adhering to good practices. In addition to the engagement the Fidelis UI must also be usable and simple whilst remaining elegant and intuitive. Responsive design is also crucial to provide access to the system across a range of devices, and this is discussed later in more detail. The provided designs were produced as mock-ups, but were designed in such a way as to closely replicate the final product.
