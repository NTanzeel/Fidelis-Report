\section{Data Processing}
Processing data in Fidelis plays a key role in meeting the requirements set by the stakeholders. Data processing will occur through abuse detection on posts to remove abusive and derogatory content from the site, content filtering to recognise trending topics and automatically categorise user-submitted posts, recommendations to provide users with fresh content to engage with, and finally reputation scoring to allow users to quantify content and user trustworthiness.
