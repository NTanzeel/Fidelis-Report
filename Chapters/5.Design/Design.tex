\label{Chapter:Design}
With a clear identification of the problem, sufficient motivations, and well defined requirements, based on informed research a design incorporating all the details could be developed. Although the design process is being carried out before the implementation phase, it is important to note that these are only initial designs. Due to the agile methodology the design and implementation processes are essentially interleaved with one another. This allows for design of one component to be completed, which can then be implemented and improved by feedback. The design of the next component will be influenced by the feedback and lessons learnt from the development of the previous components.

The first part of the design process involved coming up with an overall system architecture, which is discussed in section 5.1. However the first component to be designed would be the database as this is required by almost all other components in the system and should be readily available. In order to develop the database, a level of data collection was also necessary which is briefly touched on throughout this section.

The remainder of the design section covers the user interface design in depth for each of the significant pages on the system. The consistency of the user interface as well as design choices such as colours and layouts are also discussed. Finally a brief overview of responsive mobile design is provided.
