\section{Logo}
Figure \ref{fig:Logo} shows the design chosen for the Fidelis logo. The logo was designed in Adobe Illustrator and adheres to the orange colour scheme used throughout the UI. The aim for the design was to provide a minimalist and flat design. As such, the logo is simply an `F', symbolising the first letter of the platform name.
