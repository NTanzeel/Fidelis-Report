\label{Chapter:Evaluation}
After a comprehensive look at system design, implementation and testing, focus now turns to performing an evaluation of how well the completed system aligns with the original, envisioned idea. To this end, system requirements will be evaluated to assess how closely they met the requirements set out in Chapter \ref{Chapter:SystemRequirements}. Assessment will occur as a pass-fail test, coupled with a brief comment on each requirement. Additionally an evaluation of the legal, social, ethical and professional issues affecting the project, discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Issues}, will also be provided.

\section{Requirements}
This section of the report will look at both functional and non-functional requirements. Evaluation of each requirement, as set out in Chapter  \ref{Chapter:SystemRequirements}, is done using a pass-fail test. Along with tables detailing evaluation results for functional and non-functional requirements, the following sections will also provide justification for any requirements that have not been met.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Table \ref{tab:functional-eval} shows the results from functional requirements evaluation. This is essential in identifying whether the product has met its goals and provides the functionality set out by the project stakeholders. All functional requirements set in the project specification, and later refined, were met; the system adheres to and is capable of performing all of the desired functionalities. Users are not able to post video content as set out in \textbf{F9}. This requirement still passes though users can still post text and photo posts.

\textbf{F13}         & The system will also calculate a reputation for each user posted content to represent the quality of content                                                                                                       & A Python script will retrieve user posts and calculate the reputation for each post based on the votes on it. This script will be run periodically, meaning reputations may not always be accurate. Additionally, if a post is deemed abusive its reputation will reflect this & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{F14}         & Each user will be able to choose how the reputation is calculated and how the notion of trust is implemented                                                                                                       &    Only one technique for reputation scoring was implemented.

\textbf{F15}         & The system will incorporate abuse detection to prevent things such as profanity, swearing and nudity amongst other things                                                                                          & Fidelis has in place an abuse detection classifier that is able to detect abusive content. Similarly to the script calculating reputations, the classifier will be run periodically on user posts                                                                                                & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{F16}         & Users can report content which they find is inappropriate or offensive, such as profanity or nudity                                                                                                                &  Users can flag posts they find inappropriate using the flag icon that accompanies each post. Flagged items are used to re-train the abuse detection classifier to increase its accuracy in detecting abusive content                                                                                             & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\ \hline

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements ensure that the developed solution is applicable to usage in the real word. Functional requirements may ensure that the system provides all the features required, but these could be entirely useless if the system is not user friendly as no one would use it. Table \ref{tab:nonfunctional-eval} discusses all the non-functional requirements and how closely these requirements were met. The comments column discusses how the requirement was met and whether any aspects of the requirement were missed. 

As visible in the table, the only requirement that was not fully satisfied and hence didn't receive a pass was requirement \textbf{NF4} regarding scalability. This is because although all the decision were made with storage and other resources in mind, some of the decisions were made due to the nature of the service and could not be compromised to meet this requirement. This is especially true for the uploading of resources, which is a necessary part of the system but uses up a significant amount of storage space. This was optimised as far as possible but at a point the hardware will not be sufficient and will have to be expanded. In addition, as the system grows, having one server will not be sufficient enough to deal with the load and the network will need to be expanded.

\textbf{NF1}          & Compatibility      & Fidelis is compatible across all devices. Using Bootstrap for front-end development, cross-platform compatibility was guaranteed. System functionality is compatible for mobile devices, but some features may be hidden  & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF2}          & Usability &       The decision to imitate Twitter UI design meant that the system inherited designs that have been refined over time to provide a good user experience     & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF3}          & Security & All data held by Fidelis is stored in a password-protected database. Additionally, user credentials are encrypted when stored. The option to make user accounts private add an additional security layer to protecting user data & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF4}          & Scalability &  Whilst all decisions taken have been taken with storage and processing power in mind, larger datasets may result in slow response from the system on the current hardware. Due to the fact that users are allowed to upload resources, it is difficult to contain storage within a limit and hardware upgrades will be necessary as the system grows. It is also impossible to test this requirement without a large user base & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF5}          & Extensibility                                                                                                                         & The system was developed using a modular approach made possible through the use of an MVC approach. This means that the system can be expanded at any time as each module is completely independent of another and can be upgraded or replaced with ease. This also allows new functionality to be integrated into the system with ease.      & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF6}          & Maintainability   &                                                                                         The system is made maintainable by the documentation on all of the PHP code written throughout the project. Good coding practices as laid out by the frameworks and PHP manual were used. In addition, version control was used with through details provided for each commit. A regular update was performed for the Laravel framework to ensure that the latest version was being used. All third party apis use a CDN which means they're updated as soon as new version become available. & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS}\\
\textbf{NF7}          & Readability &                                                                                      As mentioned in maintainability, the code has been well documented. This is done only for the PHP code as the remaining code is relatively self explanatory. All changes were logged through version control as well as other progress tracking tools and a clear outline is provided in this report. & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\\hline

\section{Project Management}
The decision to use agile techniques for development, as discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:ProjectManagement}, enabled the project to evolve in parallel with changing project requirements. Using these techniques also provided developers with a creative freedom, which in itself played a hand in refining requirements. Adopting a ``custom'' agile approach that facilitated extensive documentation was a good idea. This addition to agile techniques introduced structure to the project. Changes made to the project timeline occurred, and are discussed again in Chapter \ref{Chapter:ProjectManagement}, but as mentioned these did not affect development work and were dealt with effectively due to chosen methodologies. The tools employed for both both development and management were a success. Development tools were current and up to date, meaning all development work done with age well. The management tools used meant that all work was done transparently, and created multiple channels through which work could be discussed and evaluated. The risk analysis performed at the start of the project set it up to be able to cope with any minor or major risk. Fortunately, no major risks were realised. Few developer illnesses and unavailability plagued the project, but these events were planned for and handled effectively.
