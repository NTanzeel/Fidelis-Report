\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{Chapter:Evaluation}
After a comprehensive look at system design, implementation and testing, focus now turns to performing an evaluation of how well the completed system aligns with the original, envisioned idea. To this end, system requirements will be evaluated to assess how closely they met the requirements set out in Chapter \ref{Chapter:SystemRequirements}. Assessment will occur as a pass-fail test, coupled with a brief comment on each requirement. Additionally an evaluation of the legal, social, ethical and professional issues affecting the project, discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Issues}, will also be provided.

\section{Requirements}
This section of the report will look at both functional and non-functional requirements. Evaluation of each requirement, as set out in Chapter  \ref{Chapter:SystemRequirements}, is done using a pass-fail test. Along with tables detailing evaluation results for functional and non-functional requirements, the following sections will also provide justification for any requirements that have not been met.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
Table \ref{tab:functional-eval} shows the results from functional requirements evaluation. This is essential in identifying whether the product has met its goals and provides the functionality set out by the project stakeholders. All functional requirements set in the project specification, and later refined, were met; the system adheres to and is capable of performing all of the desired functionalities.

\subsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements ensure that the developed solution is applicable to usage in the real word. Functional requirements may ensure that the system provides all the features required, but these could be entirely useless if the system is not user friendly. Table \ref{tab:nonfunctional-eval} discusses all the non-functional requirements and how closely these requirements were met. The comments column discusses how the requirement was met and whether any aspects of the requirement were missed. As visible in the table, all requirements were passed; the system goes beyond just being functional and additionally meets, amongst other things, criteria set for usability, scalability and extensibility.

\textbf{NF1}          & Compatibility      & Fidelis is compatible across all devices. Using Bootstrap for front-end development, cross-platform compatibility was guaranteed. System functionality is compatible for mobile devices, but some features may be hidden  & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF2}          & Usability &       The decision to imitate Twitter UI design meant that the system inherited designs that have been refined over time to provide a good user experience     & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF3}          & Security & All data held by Fidelis is stored in a password-protected database. Additionally, user credentials are encrypted when stored. The option to make user accounts private add an additional security layer to protecting user data & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\
\textbf{NF4}          & Scalability &  Whilst all decisions taken have been taken with storage and processing power in mind, larger datasets may result in slow response from the system on the current hardware. Due to the fact that users are allowed to upload resources, it is difficult to contain storage within a limit and hardware upgrades will be necessary as the system grows. It is also impossible to test this requirement without a large user base & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS} \\

Good coding practices as laid out by the frameworks and PHP manual were used. In addition, version control was used with through details provided for each commit. A regular update was performed for the Laravel framework to ensure that the latest version was being used. All third party apis use a CDN which means they're updated as soon as new version become available. & {\color[HTML]{34FF34} PASS}\\

\section{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}
At the outset of this project, a number of legal, ethical, social and professional issues that could affect the Fidelis platform were identified. These issues were discussed fully in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Issues}. It is critical to review the issues discussed and identify how they have been addressed, and as such this section will look at these issues were confronted. In terms of legal issues, there could be concern that the content/activity of a user may have implications for Fidels, for example a user posting copyright infringing content. It has therefore been outlined in the Fidelis Terms of Service that a user is responsible for their own content and activity on the Fidelis platform and also that any content deemed illegal may be removed.

Social issues included the consideration of social networks and their relationship with mental health. It has been made clear that users should only post content they are comfortable with sharing to avoid users regretting doing so and the support section of the website suggests some ways a user can find help. This includes contact details and website of Samaritan's \cite{Samaritans:Home}, a charity providing assistance in talking over any issues a person may be having in their life and offering support to help that person overcome these issues.

There are also ethical considerations for the Fidelis platform. It may be the case that users may not wish for everybody to see their posts. It has therefore been ensured that users can set their accounts to `private' on their settings page. This will prevent non-approved users from seeing the content they share. In addition there is the potential for the bias of any person(s) involved in the development of the Fidelis platform to affect the content recommended. Fidelis has been designed and implemented in such a way that content recommendation and filtering is based on user preferences as well as the content the user interacts with and they should primarily be shown content from other users that post `good' content, i.e., content/users with a high reputation. There is no reason that the views of anyone involved in developing the platform should affect the end-user content.

On a professional level it was noted that the Fidelis platform is required to adhere to the Data Protection of 1998 \cite{DPA}. In order to comply, it has been ensured that the database is as secure as possible. Sensitive data such as user passwords are encrypted to protect their information and any request to interact with data from the database (both retrieving and inserting data) requires checks such as ensuring the user is logged into an account and cannot retrieve data related to another user. This way no individual can have access to data that they are not authorised to access, maintaining data confidentiality.

\section{Project Management}
The decision to use agile techniques for development, as discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:ProjectManagement}, enabled the project to evolve in parallel with changing project requirements. Using these techniques also provided developers with a creative freedom, which in itself played a hand in refining requirements. Adopting a ``custom'' agile approach that facilitated extensive documentation was a good idea. This addition to agile techniques introduced structure to the project. Changes made to the project timeline occurred, and are discussed again in Chapter \ref{Chapter:ProjectManagement}, but as mentioned these did not affect development work and were dealt with effectively due to chosen methodologies. The tools employed for both both development and management were a success. Development tools were current and up to date, meaning all development work done will age well. The management tools used meant that all work was done transparently, and created multiple channels through which work could be discussed and evaluated. The risk analysis performed at the start of the project set it up to be able to cope with any minor or major risk. Fortunately, no major risks were realised. Few developer illnesses and unavailability plagued the project, but these events were planned for and handled effectively.
