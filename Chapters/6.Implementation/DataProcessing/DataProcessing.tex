\section{Data Processing}
As mentioned earlier, Python was chosen for data processing. Python has an established data analysis community, and as such provides a rich assortment of open-source libraries that can be used. With a such a community, documentation was abundant and meant that the implementation of the designs discussed in Chapter \ref{Chapter:Design} were accelerated greatly. Not only this, but existing solutions for problems encountered during development were available, which again sped up the implementation process.
